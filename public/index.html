                <p>Losing weight and gaining muscle can be difficult when you're not sure exactly how much energy your body is burning and how many calories you need to consume in order to reach your desired fitness goals.</p>
                <p>Your <b>BMR</b> (Basal Metabolic Rate) gives you an estimate of how many calories your body burns per day while at rest. This is considered the absolute minimum amount of calories your body requires to function and regularly failing to eat at or above it can negatively impact your health. There are many equations that can be used to calculate this number and while none will be 100% accurate, we use the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation which is often considered among the most accurate.</p>
                <p>Your <b>TDEE</b> (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is an estimate of how many calories your body burns per day, on average, based on your general activity level. This number can vary a little more widely than your BMR due to changing day-to-day activity levels, as well as the exact multipliers used during calculations. Despite this, you can further fine-tune your TDEE with consistent weight tracking and experimentation to see what works best for your individual needs.</p>
                <p>Eating below your TDEE puts you in a caloric deficit, which can help with weight loss, while eating above it puts you in a caloric surplus, which can help with gaining mass. Regularly meeting your TDEE helps you maintain your current body, a few normal fluctuations notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>By taking both your BMR and TDEE into consideration, you can develop a better understanding of the massive role your body's daily energy needs play on your fitness journey and how even small adjustments to one's diet can lead to big changes over time.</p>
